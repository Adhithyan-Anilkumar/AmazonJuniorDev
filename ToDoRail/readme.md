This project focuses on creating a full-stack web application for managing to-do tasks, integrating various skills learned throughout the course Full Stack Web Development.

-User Registration and Login
Users can register for an account by providing their details and creating a password.
Upon successful registration, they are redirected to a login page; if unsuccessful, they receive feedback and can try again.

-Dashboard Functionality
After logging in, users access a personalized dashboard displaying their tasks, categorized as pending or completed.
Tasks due on the current date are highlighted and color-coded based on priority (red for high, yellow for medium, green for low).

-Task Management Features
Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

The application ensures secure management of user data using Spring Boot security, requiring users to log in to access their tasks.
